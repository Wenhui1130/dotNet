-- JOIN
-- INNER JOIN: Tselects records that have matching values in both tables.
-- OUTER JOIN -> LEFT JOIN , RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN
-- LEFT JOIN: returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.
-- RIGHT JOIN: returns all records from the right table (table1), and the matching records from the left table (table2). The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match.
-- FULL (OUTER) JOIN : returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.
